  description: |||
    HydroSHEDS is a mapping product that provides hydrographic
    information for regional and global-scale applications in a consistent
    format. It offers a suite of geo-referenced datasets (vector and
    raster) at various scales, including river networks, watershed
    boundaries, drainage directions, and flow accumulations. HydroSHEDS
    is based on elevation data obtained in 2000 by NASA's Shuttle Radar
    Topography Mission (SRTM).

    This flow accumulation dataset defines the amount of
    upstream area (in number of cells) draining into each cell. The
    drainage direction layer is used to define which cells flow into
    the target cell. The number of accumulated cells is essentially
    a measure of the upstream catchment area. However, since the
    cell size of the HydroSHEDS data set depends on latitude, the
    cell accumulation value cannot directly be translated into drainage
    areas in square kilometers. Values range from 1 at topographic
    highs (river sources) to very large numbers (on the order of
    millions of cells) at the mouths of large rivers.

    This dataset is at 15 arc-second resolution. The datasets available
     at 15 arc-seconds are the Hydrologically Conditioned DEM, Drainage
    (Flow) Direction, and Flow Accumulation.

    Note that the quality of the HydroSHEDS data is significantly lower for regions above
    60 degrees northern latitude as there is no underlying SRTM elevation data available
    and thus a coarser-resolution DEM was (HYDRO1k provided by USGS).

    HydroSHEDS was developed by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)
    Conservation Science Program in partnership with the U.S. Geological
    Survey, the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture, The
    Nature Conservancy, and the Center for Environmental Systems Research
    of the University of Kassel, Germany.
