  description: |||
    HydroSHEDS is a mapping product that provides hydrographic
    information for regional and global-scale applications in a consistent
    format. It offers a suite of geo-referenced datasets (vector and
    raster) at various scales, including river networks, watershed
    boundaries, drainage directions, and flow accumulations. HydroSHEDS
    is based on elevation data obtained in 2000 by NASA's Shuttle Radar
    Topography Mission (SRTM).

    This drainage direction dataset defines the direction
    of flow from each cell in the conditioned DEM to its steepest
    down-slope neighbor. Values of drainage direction vary from 1
    to 128. All final outlet cells to the ocean are flagged with
    a value of 0. All cells that mark the lowest point of an endorheic
    basin (inland sink) are flagged with a value of -1. The drainage
    direction values follow the convention adopted by ESRI's flow
    direction implementation: 1=E, 2=SE, 4=S, 8=SW, 16=W, 32=NW,
    64=N, 128=NE. \
    \
     This dataset is at 3 arc-second resolution.
    The datasets available at 3 arc-seconds are the Void-Filled DEM,
    Hydrologically Conditioned DEM, and Drainage (Flow) Direction.

    Note that the quality of the HydroSHEDS data is significantly lower for regions above
    60 degrees northern latitude as there is no underlying SRTM elevation data available
    and thus a coarser-resolution DEM was (HYDRO1k provided by USGS).

    HydroSHEDS was developed by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)
    Conservation Science Program in partnership with the U.S. Geological
    Survey, the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture, The
    Nature Conservancy, and the Center for Environmental Systems Research
    of the University of Kassel, Germany.
